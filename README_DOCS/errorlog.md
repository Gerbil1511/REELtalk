## Error Log:

1. django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "movies_movie_slug_key" DETAIL: Key (slug)=(the-matrix) already exists.

[13/Jan/2025 10:53:24] "GET /?q=the+matrix HTTP/1.1" 500 186133

Fix: modify the save method in the Movie model to ensure that slugs are unique by appending a unique identifier if a duplicate slug is detected. Additionally, you can handle this in the view to check for existing slugs before creating a new movie...


Model Changes:
The save method in the Movie model now ensures that slugs are unique by appending a unique identifier if a duplicate slug is detected.

View Changes:
The home view now checks for existing slugs before creating a new movie and ensures that the slug is unique if the movie already exists.

2. TypeError: movie_detail() got an unexpected keyword argument 'slug' [13/Jan/2025 11:01:50] "GET /movies/movie/the-greatest-showman/ HTTP/1.1" 500 69504

Fix: due to a mismatch between the URL pattern and the view function's parameters...

Check the URL Pattern:
Ensure that the URL pattern for the movie_detail view correctly captures the slug parameter.

Check the View Function:
Ensure that the movie_detail view function accepts the slug parameter.

##

3. NameError: name 'movie_id' is not defined [13/Jan/2025 11:06:25] "GET /movies/movie/the-matrix/ HTTP/1.1" 500 72757

Fix: indicates that the movie_detail view is trying to use movie_id instead of slug. The URL pattern is passing the slug parameter, so the view should use slug to look up the movie.

Correct Parameter:
The movie_detail view now correctly accepts the slug parameter and uses it to look up the movie: movie = get_object_or_404(Movie, slug=slug).

Ensure the movie_detail view correctly passes movie.tmdb_id to the fetch_movie_details function.

Verify that the utils.py file correctly handles the movie_id parameter.

##

4. No forum post is showing for a searched movie on the "movie_detail" page even though a post was added directly to the searched movie in the admin panel. the forum post is correctly linked to the movie in the admin panel, but the link is not being correctly recognized in the movie_detail view or template.

Fix: 
Model:
Ensure the ForumPost model has a foreign key relationship to the Movie model with related_name='forum_posts'.

View:
Ensure the movie_detail view fetches the related forum posts and passes them to the template.

Template:
Ensure the movie_detail.html template correctly iterates over and displays the related forum posts.

Data:
Ensure there are forum posts related to the movie in the database.

Verify URL Configuration:
Ensure that the URL pattern for forum_post_detail is correctly defined in urls.py.


##

5. django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "movies_movie_slug_key" DETAIL: Key (slug)=(wicked) already exists.

Fix: 
Update the Model:
Remove the slug field and the related logic from the Movie model.

Apply Migrations:
Create and apply the migrations to update the database schema.

Update the Views:
Ensure that the views no longer reference the slug field and use the tmdb_id instead.

Update the URL Configuration:
Update the URL configuration to use the tmdb_id instead of the slug.

Update the Templates:
Ensure that the templates use the tmdb_id instead of the slug when generating URLs.

The `IntegrityError` indicates that a `PostComment` is being saved without an `author_id`, which violates the not-null constraint on the `author` field. This typically happens when the `author` field is not set before saving the comment.
